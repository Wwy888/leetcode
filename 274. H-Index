Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.


class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int i=0;
        int n=citations.length;
        for(int c:citations)
        {
            
            if(c>=n-i)
            {
                return n-i;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}


用到arrays.sort方法，让数组从小到大排序，
foreach 循环，遍历数组，for（int x:arrays)
返回H因子：
A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each.”
如果没有符合，返回0；
