You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows. 

Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.

Example 1:

Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"

Output: "1A3B"

Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.
Example 2:

Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"

Output: "1A1B"

Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow.
Note: You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.



class Solution:
    def getHint(self, secret: str, guess: str) -> str:
        s=list(secret)
        g=list(guess)
        a=0
        b=0
        x="x"
        y="y"
        c=0
        for i in range(len(secret)):
            if g[i]==s[i]:
                a+=1
                s.pop(i)
                s.insert(i,x)
                g.pop(i)
                g.insert(i,y)
        for c in range(len(secret)):
            for j in range(len(guess)):
                     if g[c]==s[j]:
                        s.pop(j)
                        s.insert(j,x)
                        b+=1
                        break
        return "{}A{}B".format(a,b)
        
    pop 和 insert 函数
    list 和array ：在python中，list 是python 的内置数据类型，list 中的数据不用完全形同，但是array 中的类型必须完全相同。
